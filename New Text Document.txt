<p><b><i> the powers of "Spider-Man&rdquo; after he is bitten by a radioactive spider, </b></i><br><br>Peter Parker is
            beset as much by the travails and problems of ordinary life as he is with fighting supervillains. His powers
            give him the ability to do good, but seriously complicate his career and personal relationships. In spite of
            this, he feels a strong duty to do what he can to fight crime and corruption. This goes back to a moment of inaction
            when, after newly acquiring his superpowers, Peter allowed a thief to escape, who subsequently killed his Uncle
            Ben. Realizing that he could have prevented his uncle's death, Peter commits to a life of crimefighting and helping
            others, driven by his uncle's words, "With great power there must also come great responsibility. £ &euro;"<br><br><br><br>
